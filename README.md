# connect4-general

A better connect 4 website where you can play against bots implemented with generalized algorithms.

# features

* `index.html`: normal website where you can play against one of the bots.
* `1v1.html`: runs one game between two bots on display, and then runs 1000 more and keeps track of the stats.

# todo

* do some ui stuff
  * save state
  * new game
  * board size
  * animations?
